.SH NOTES
When playing an Audio-CD skip-left and skip-right react a little late. The same for commands like 'U', 'D' and HOME.
.PP
A DAISY 2.02-medium normally contains a single book. If more than one DAISY book is provided on the same medium, each book is stored in a separate folder (directory) of its own. In the root of the CD, DVD, or other media a file called discinfo.html is created that contains links to all books on the medium.
(See <https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/daisy-2/daisy-format-2-0-specification/>)
.PP
A DAISY 3-book has two index-files for navigation, a NCX and an OPF file. Daisy-player tries to detemine which of these two files give the best result. But sometimes daisy-playr is not able to make the best choice. When in doubt use option "\fB--N\fP" to force the use of NCX or "\fB-O\fP" to force the OPF. This is only for DAISY format 3 books.
