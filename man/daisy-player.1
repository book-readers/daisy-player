.SH DESCRIPTION
Daisy-player reads a Daisy-CD and plays the audio-files.
DAISY versions 2.02 and 3 are currently supported, as well as volumes with multiple books.

Daisy-player also can play Audio-CD's and tries to get CD-information from a cddb-database.
.PP
A list of items on the Daisy-CD or Audio-CD will appear. Press <ENTER> to start playing. When reading of an item has finished, \fBdaisy-player\fP will play the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.

.SH NOTES
On some soundcards (especially onboard cards) the alsa driver only can play one file at a time. \fBdaisy-player\fP crashes sometimes on these cards. From this version on the pulseaudio sound-driver will be used instead. The pulseaudio sound system has no problems with these cards.
.PP
I don't know how to play with pulseaudio in the C function sox_open_write (). For now, the external command sox will be used instead.
.PP
When playing an Audio-CD skip-left and skip-right react a little late. The same for commands like 'U', 'D' and HOME.
