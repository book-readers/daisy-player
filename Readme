USAGE
As a mortal user, put a DAISY-cd in your cd-player and,
on the command line, give:

   $ daisy-player

This starts reading the DAISY-CD and printing the content on
the screen. After giving an [ENTER], playing the audio files starts.

structure as argument to daisy-player:

   $ daisy-player /home/jos/daisy_dir

A list of items on the DAISY-CD will appear. Press <ENTER>
to start playing. When reading of an item has finished, daisy-player will
play the next item and the cursor will automatically skip
to that item, so that your braille-terminal will display the name
of that item.
Daisy-player plays the audio on the default sound device.

For keyboard navigation, plese press 'h' or '?'.

Daisy-player is multilingual. The following languages are currently supported:
english, german, dutch.
