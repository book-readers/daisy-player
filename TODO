- .mo files in /usr/local/share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/
  The path /usr/local/share/locale/ is hardcoded in the source.
  How to set the path from the command-line?

-      The *.wav "files" will be played using the sox library.
       Currently the "files" are played with sox_flow_effects(),
       but I want to use sox_read() and sox_write() instead of
       sox_flow_effects(), sothat the tempo effect can be used while playing.
       But:

          e = sox_create_effect (sox_find_effect ("tempo"));
          args[0] = tempo, sox_effect_options (e, 1, args);
          sox_add_effect (chain, e, &sox_in->signal, &sox_in->signal);

       only works with sox_flow_effects().

       Does anyone know how to set effects in conjunction with sox_read()
       and sox_write()???
