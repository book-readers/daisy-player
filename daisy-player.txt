NAME
daisy-player - player for DAISY Digital Talking Books
SYNOPSIS
daisy-player [directory_with_a_Daisy-structure] [-d ALSA_sound_device]
DESCRIPTION
Daisy-player reads a Daisy-CD and plays the audio-files.
Only DAISY version 2 is currently supported.

A list of items on the Daisy-CD will appear. Press <ENTER> to start playing. When reading of an item has finished, daisy-player will play the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.

Daisy-player supports the following languages: english, german and dutch.

 SCREEN
The name and version of this program and the name of the author will be displayed left aligned at the top of the screen. The name of the current loaded book will be displayed right aligned.

The next rows will display the title of the item, the first page of the item within brackets (if there are pages) and the playing time. Items in higher levels will be indented. (Three spaces each level.) When "just playing this item" is active, a "J" will be viewed at the first column of that item.
