To compile daisy-player, be sure the following extra packages are installed:

   libncursesw5-dev
   libsox-dev
   libxml2-dev
   libcdio-dev
   libcdio-cdda-dev
   libcdio-paranoia-dev
   libmagic-dev

Give the following commands:        

   $ ./configure
   $ make

As root:

   # make install

NOTE:

In the playfile() function, the typedef enum sox_option_no is used. This
is for libsox versions => 14.4.
To compile this package for older libSoX versions, use SOX_OPTION_NO.
See /usr/include/sox.h.
