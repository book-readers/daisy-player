NAME
daisy-player - player for DAISY Digital Talking Books or Audio-CD's

SYNOPSIS
daisy-player [directory_with_a_Daisy-structure |
Daisy_book_archive] [-c cdrom_device] [-d audio_device:audio_type] [-h]
[-i] [-T] [-n | -y] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
Daisy-player reads a Daisy-CD and plays the audio-files.
DAISY versions 2.02 and 3 are currently supported, as well as media with multiple books. (discinfo)

Daisy-player also can play Audio-CD's and tries to get CD-information from a cddb-database.

A list of items on the Daisy-CD or Audio-CD will appear. Press <ENTER> to start playing. When reading of an item has finished, daisy-player will play the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.

OPTIONS
directory_with_a_Daisy-structure  One could also give a directory with a daisy structure as argument to daisy-player.
Daisy_book_archive  One could also give an archive with a daisy structure as  argument to daisy-player. Many archive-formats are supported like .tar.gz or .zip. The archive will be unpacked using the "unar"-utility.
-c cdrom_device  Use DEVICE as the CD device. DEVICE is the device special file name of the CD-ROM device. The default is /dev/sr0. Be sure the user is a member of the group cdrom.
-d audio_device:audio_type  Daisy-player will play on this sound device of given audio_type. The value must be of the form "audio_device:audio_type". Example: "-d default:alsa", "hw:0:alsa" or "0:pulseaudio". This option overrules the value in the ~/.daisy-player.xml config file. Be sure the user is a member of the group "audio".
-h  Display this help and exit.
-i  Ignore reading of the bookmarks.
-T  Do not display the time passing during playback.
-n  Don't fetch cddb-information of an Audio-CD from the internet.
-y  Fetch cddb-information of an Audio-CD from the internet.
-v  Be more verbose, so one can se what's going on while initializing.

SCREEN
The name and version of this program and the name of the author will be displayed left aligned at the top of the screen. The name of the current loaded book will be displayed right aligned.

The second row of the screen will display the number of pages of the current loaded book (if any), the current selected level and the total number of levels, the total playing time, the current displayed screen and the total number of screens.

The next rows will display the title of the item, the first page of that item within brackets (if there are pages) and the playing time. Items in higher levels will be indented. (Three spaces each level.) When "just playing this item" is active, a "J" will be viewed at the first column of that item.

NOTES
When playing an Audio-CD skip-left and skip-right react a little late. The same for commands like 'U', 'D' and HOME.

A DAISY 2.02-medium normally contains a single book. If more than one DAISY book is provided on the same medium, each book is stored in a separate folder (directory) of its own. In the root of the CD, DVD, or other media a file called discinfo.html is created that contains links to all books on the medium.
(See <https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/daisy-2/daisy-format-2-0-specification/>)

A DAISY 3-book has two index-files for navigation, a NCX and an OPF file. Daisy-player tries to detemine which of these two files give the best result. But sometimes daisy-playr is not able to make the best choice. When in doubt use option "--N" to force the use of NCX or "-O" to force the OPF. This is only for DAISY format 3 books.
