Unfortunately there is no log for previous versions of daisy-player. :-(

5.3.1.1	The titles will be truncated when they are to long.
5.4	Select an alternative soundcard using aplay
	(Not implemented yet)
5.4.1	Update of the manpage.
5.5	Daisy-player is now multilingual. (english, german and dutch)
	Thanks to Klaus Knopper <knopper@knopper.net>

	The eject function ('e') now works.
5.5.1	cd will be umounted when quiting.
6.0	The extern command madplay is not needed anymore.
	Daisy-player now has an mp3 player built-in.
	With the -d option one can specify an alternative sound device/.
6.1	Now daisy-player is able to increase or decrease playing speed
	Selecting an alternative soundcard now works.
6.1.1	The extern command madplay is introduced again.
	The files on a daisy-cd will be played using sox, But the "trim"
	effect of sox is very slow, so madplay will be used to cut
	the audio-files and sox will play the cut-out.
6.1.2	Test for the existence of madplay and sox.
6.1.3	PRoblem with lang like nl or de is solved.
	The comma in speed=1,0000 will be changed in a dot.
6.1.4	The directory containing message catalogs is set with the
	bindtextdomain() function.
	Currently it is set to "/usr/local/share/locale".
6.2	HTML entities are now converted to UTF8.
	(like "&lt;" to "<"
6.2.1	In place of the sox executable dp now uses the sox library itself.
6.2.2	Problem with setlocale() solved.
6.2.3	Multiplexing added. Thanks to Halim Sahin <halim.sahin@t-online.de>
	for the patch.
6.2.4	Test if the requested sound device exists.
	If not, use "default".
6.2.5	The search function now searches from the current cursor position till
	the end of the list and from the first item of the list till
	the current cursor position.
	The 'N'-command searches the other way round.
	Error messages from the SoX library will be discarded.
	The page-find function ('g') now finds the correct page.
	The cursor left and right commands now take into account
	the current level.
6.3	madplay is not needed anymore. (For real this time. `-) )
	It has been dropped in favor of the cutmp3 package.
	Cutmp3 - Jochen Puchalla <mail@puchalla-online.de>
	Thanks for his work!
	The "store current item to disk" function now uses the sox
	library instead of madplay.
6.4	madplay is back again!
	Cutmp3 was not as good as I hoped, unfortunately. :-(
6.4.1	Tempo change with D and U are limited.
7.0.0	Daisy-player now also can handle daisy version 3.
7.0.2	When LANG=de_DE.utf8 '.' in numbers became ','.
	madplay -s can't handle numbers with a comma.
	So, when LANG is de or nl, force decimal point in numbers with:
	setlocale (LC_NUMERIC, "C");
7.0.4	https://bugs.launchpad.net/daisy-player/+bug/818112

	The following procedure makes daisy-player crash repeatedly on my
	computer:

	Pause a playing daisy book by pressing the space-bar.
	View the key bindings by pressing the question mark.
	Press the space-bar twice to go to the next screen. After the second
	space-bar daisy-player crashes.

	solved.
7.0.5	Remove bookmark when reading is finished.
7.1	Removed my own xml parser in favour of the Mini-XML library.

  closedir (dir); after all dirent operations
7.2	The Mini-XML library is replaced by libxml2.
	XML toolkit from the GNOME project
	Copyright (C) 1998-2002 Daniel Veillard.  All Rights Reserved.

	The Mini-XML library gave problems in some xml-files.

	The following files are not needed anymore:

	   UCkd.h
	   UCkd.txt
	   entities.h
	   entities.txt
	Daisy-player is also available in Afrikaans.
	Thanks to Willem van der Walt <wvdwalt@csir.co.za>

        Thanks to Osvaldo La Rosa <aldo.nospam@scarlet.be>
        and also available in Spanish.
        Thanks to Hanna Tulleken <hannatulleken@gmail.com>
7.3	Norwegian version translated by Ellen <ellenrohaan@hotmail.com>
	Hungarian version translated by Hammer Attila <hammera@pickup.hu>
	The function realname() is not needed anymore
8.0	Daisy-player now also can play Audio-CD's.
	The cd will be "mounted" using gvfs.
	The "cddbget" tool will be used to fetch Audio-CD information.

	   CDDB_get was written by Armin Obersteiner <armin@xos.net>.

	The *.wav "files" will be played using the sox library.
	Currently the "files" are played with sox_flow_effects(),
	but I want to use sox_read() and sox_write() instead of
	sox_flow_effects(), sothat the tempo effect can be used while playing.
	But:

	   e = sox_create_effect (sox_find_effect ("tempo"));
	   args[0] = tempo, sox_effect_options (e, 1, args);
	   sox_add_effect (chain, e, &sox_in->signal, &sox_in->signal);

	only works with sox_flow_effects().

	Does anyone know how to set effects in conjunction with sox_read()
	and sox_write()???
8.0.1	The files error.wav and error.txt are dropped.
	Introduced the option -c for an alternative cdrom-device.
	Introduced the option -n to disable the use of cddbget.
	Daisy-player will test if there is a cd-drive.
8.0.2	cd-drive test now works, I hope :)
	cd_dev and cddb_flag in .daisy-player.rc file.
	set the CD speed at 4 so it makes less noise
8.1
	gvfs has been dropped.
	daisy-player now uses the cdio library.
8.1.1	Audio-CD's are played now with the sox "cdda" type.
	Add MCN to names of bookmarks for better identification. (Audio-CD)
8.2	'g' command in Audio_CD's. Skip to a time in current song.
	No more silence between Audio-CD tracks.
8.3	Better checking for cd-drive and soundcard permissions.
	Better support for Audio cd's.
8.3.1	Crash when no ~/.daisy-player.rc: solved.
	Daisy-player now also can read zip-files.
8.4	Better testing for cd device.
	Better testing for audio device.
	The "unzip" program is replaced by the "unar" program, so
	daisy-player can read all kinds of compressed files, not
	only ".zip" files.
8.4.1   Added setlocale (LC_ALL, getenv ("LANGUAGE")); and
	setlocale (LC_ALL, getenv ("LANG"));
8.4.2	-   setlocale (LC_ALL, getenv ("LC_ALL"));
	-   setlocale (LC_ALL, getenv ("LANGUAGE"));
	-   setlocale (LC_ALL, getenv ("LANG"));
	+   setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
	In 8.4.1 two lines were accidentally deleted:

	   str = (char *) malloc (MAX_STR);
	   s = MAX_STR - 1;

	are introduced again.
8.4.3	setlocale (LC_NUMERIC, "C"); added to force a decimal point
	independently of the used language.
8.4.4	Updated hungarian translation
8.4.5	Added an polish translation
8.5	Better support for volumes with multiple daisy-books (discinfo.html)
8.5.1	Start daisy-player with a volume with multiple daisy-books.
	(discinfo.html). After quiting daisy-player the terminal is locked.
	This occured when daisy-player was started from a bash shell.
	When started from a tcsh shell there was no problem.
	Solved.
8.5.2	Added option "-s" to the tempo effect of sox. This causes
	smoother sound by very low tempo.
8.6	Time viewing depends on the playing speed.
	How faster the playing speed, shorter times are shown. And vv.
	The udisks package has been dropped in favor of the udisks2 package.
8.6.1	All global variables deleted.
	daisy-player now only uses loacal variables
	The daisy_t struct array now only gets the number of needed
	elements. Older versions got staticly 2000 elements.
8.6.2	Daisy-player crashed on systems without an cd player.
	Solved!
8.6.3	Now really, I hope
8.7	Introduced new option "-i". when this option is detected,
	the bookmark file will be ignored.
8.7.1	When started with the "-i" option and the spacebar was pressed,
	an error occured:

	   open_smil_file():
	   : Bad file descriptor

	Solved.
8.8	Added an Portuguese translation.
9.0	Introduced time searching in Daisy-books with the 'g' command.
	Like time searching when an audio-CD is found.
	The command to go to a page number now is 'G'.
9.1	Updated the man-page.
9.2	Updated The online help screen.
9.3	On  some  systems daisy-player quits with the message that the
	soundcard cannot be used. I have experienced with the pulseaudio
	and the AO drivers, but with no luck.
	I don't know how to solve this  problem  yet, sorry.
	For now, when the ALSA hw:0 card cannot be opened for writing
	AO default will be used instead.
	Added an Swedish translation.
	Updated the Spanish translation.
10.0	Updated the French translation.
	Entities like &aring; = Ã¥ are now correctly displayed
10.1	When playing faster or slower than normal speed, viewing
	of the remaining time went wrong. Solved.
	Time searching in an item now takes in account the selected
	playing-speed.
10.2	Added an Slovenian translation
10.2.2	Pause/resume problem solved.
	Better support for skip left/right in Audio-CD's.
	Apparently something has changed in the libcdio.so.13 library.
	The cdio_set_speed () function. causes now a segmentation
	fault, so I deleted the use of it.
	Apparently something has changed in the libxml2.so.2 library.
	In earlier versions daisy-player used
	   xmlTextReaderGetAttribute (reader, (const xmlChar *) "clipBegin")
	But that doesn't work anymore. Daisy-player now uses
	   xmlTextReaderGetAttribute (reader, (const xmlChar *) "clipbegin")
	I think it is not handy that this library now makes defference
	between upercase and lowercase characters.
10.2.3	Time viewing while playing was corrupt in the last version.
	Solved.
	The problem about libxml2.so.2 I mentioned in 10.2.2 is solved.
	For one reason or another it works again. I don't know what
	happened, sorry
10.2.4	Now I know what happened. The problem occured only in DAISY version 3.
	But I tested daisy-player on DAISY version 2.2. I messed up the
	two versions, stupid me!
10.2.4.1
	Little bug in time viewing for Audio CD's solved.
10.3	Daisy-player only worked on a cd with ISO9660 filesystem.
	Now it also works on cd's with a Universal Disk Format (UDF)
	filesystem.
10.4	html entities are converted correctly again.
	daisy-player now uses the htmlParseFile() function of libxml2.
	All files will be treated now as UTF-8.
	Playback volume can be altered with 'v' and 'V'.
	The skip_left() function has been simplified.
	New language added: Guatemala. Should also be usefull for
	other Central American countries.
	Updated the French translation.
	Filenames now will be treated case insensitive.
	The external executable "find" has been dropped in favour
	of an internal function that scans for the "ncc.html",
	"*.ncx" and "*.opf" files.
	man/Makefile.am changes.
	Finnish translation by Jani Kinnunen <janikinnunen340@gmail.com>.
10.4.1	es.po was mixed up with fi.po.
10.5	daisy-player crashed when no cd device couldn't be found.
10.5.1	htmlParseFile gave some strange errors in the function load_xml(),
	so it is replaced by xmlRecoverFile.
10.5.2	When playback is paused, wait for playback is really stopped.
10.6	Alter  playback volume with ALSA instead off altering the volume
	of the soundfile itself with sox.
        The external madplay application is no longer needed.
        "store current item to disk" now takes in account the current level.
10.6.1	Test for the existence of an ALSA sound device.
10.6.4	Option -h will not read .daisy-player.xml.
	Processes hanged while playing Audio-CD's. Solved.
10.6.4.1 Forgot to update the TODO and Changelog files in the previous
	version.
11.0	On some soundcards (especially onboard cards) the alsa driver
	only can play one file at a time.
	daisy-player crashes sometimes on these cards.
	From this version on the pulseaudio sound-driver will be used
	instead. pulseaudio has no problems with these cards.
	I don't know how to play with pulseaudio in the C function
	sox_open_write ().,
	For now, the external command sox will be used instead.
11.1	store to disk now works.
11.2	Altering the playback volume only worked on the first soundcard.
	Now playback volume works on all found cards.
