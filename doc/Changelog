Unfortunately there is no log for previous versions of daisy-player. :-(

5.3.1.1	The titles will be truncated when they are to long.
5.4	Select an alternative soundcard using aplay
	(Not implemented yet)
5.4.1	Update of the manpage.
5.5	Daisy-player is now multilingual. (english, german and dutch)
	Thanks to Klaus Knopper <knopper@knopper.net>

	The eject function ('e') now works.
5.5.1	cd will be umounted when quiting.
6.0	The extern command madplay is not needed anymore.
	Daisy-player now has an mp3 player built-in.

6.1	Now daisy-player is able to increase or decrease playing speed
	Selecting an alternative soundcard now works.
6.1.1	The extern command madplay is introduced again.
	The files on a daisy-cd will be played using sox, But the "trim"
	effect of sox is very slow, so madplay will be used to cut
	the audio-files and sox will play the cut-out.
6.1.2	Test for the existence of madplay and sox.
6.1.3	PRoblem with lang like nl or de is solved.
	The comma in speed=1,0000 will be changed in a dot.
6.1.4	The directory containing message catalogs is set with the
	bindtextdomain() function.
	Currently it is set to "/usr/local/share/locale".
6.2	HTML entities are now converted to UTF8.
	(like "&lt;" to "<"
6.2.1	In place of the sox executable dp now uses the sox library itself.
6.2.2	Problem with setlocale() solved.
6.2.3	Multiplexing added. Thanks to Halim Sahin <halim.sahin@t-online.de>
	for the patch.
6.2.4	Test if the requested sound device exists.
	If not, use "default".
6.2.5	The search function now searches from the current cursor position till
	the end of the list and from the first item of the list till
	the current cursor position.
	The 'N'-command searches the other way round.
	Error messages from the SoX library will be discarded.
	The page-find function ('g') now finds the correct page.
	The cursor left and right commands now take into account
	the current level.
6.3	madplay is not needed anymore. (For real this time. `-) )
	It has been dropped in favor of the cutmp3 package.
	Cutmp3 - Jochen Puchalla <mail@puchalla-online.de>
	Thanks for his work!
	The "store current item to disk" function now uses the sox
	library instead of madplay.
6.4	madplay is back again!
	Cutmp3 was not as good as I hoped, unfortunately. :-(
6.4.1	Tempo change with D and U are limited.
7.0.0	Daisy-player now also can handle daisy version 3.
7.0.2	When LANG=de_DE.utf8 '.' in numbers became ','.
	madplay -s can't handle numbers with a comma.
	So, when LANG is de or nl, force decimal point in numbers with:
	setlocale (LC_NUMERIC, "C");
7.0.4	https://bugs.launchpad.net/daisy-player/+bug/818112

	The following procedure makes daisy-player crash repeatedly on my
	computer:

	Pause a playing daisy book by pressing the space-bar.
	View the key bindings by pressing the question mark.
	Press the space-bar twice to go to the next screen. After the second
	space-bar daisy-player crashes.

	solved.
7.0.5	Remove bookmark when reading is finished.
7.1	Removed my own xml parser in favour of the Mini-XML library.

  closedir (dir); after all dirent operations
7.2	The Mini-XML library is replaced by libxml2.
	XML toolkit from the GNOME project
	Copyright (C) 1998-2002 Daniel Veillard.  All Rights Reserved.

	The Mini-XML library gave problems in some xml-files.

	The following files are not needed anymore:

	   UCkd.h
	   UCkd.txt
	   entities.h
	   entities.txt
	Daisy-player is also available in Afrikaans.
	Thanks to Willem van der Walt <wvdwalt@csir.co.za>

        Thanks to Osvaldo La Rosa <aldo.nospam@scarlet.be>
        and also available in Spanish.
        Thanks to Hanna Tulleken <hannatulleken@gmail.com>
7.3	Norwegian version translated by Ellen <ellenrohaan@hotmail.com>
	Hungarian version translated by Hammer Attila <hammera@pickup.hu>
	The function realname() is not needed anymore
8.0	Daisy-player now also can play Audio-CD's.
	The cd will be "mounted" using gvfs.
	The "cddbget" tool will be used to fetch Audio-CD information.

	   CDDB_get was written by Armin Obersteiner <armin@xos.net>.

	The *.wav "files" will be played using the sox library.
	Currently the "files" are played with sox_flow_effects(),
	but I want to use sox_read() and sox_write() instead of
	sox_flow_effects(), sothat the tempo effect can be used while playing.
	But:

	   e = sox_create_effect (sox_find_effect ("tempo"));
	   args[0] = tempo, sox_effect_options (e, 1, args);
	   sox_add_effect (chain, e, &sox_in->signal, &sox_in->signal);

	only works with sox_flow_effects().

	Does anyone know how to set effects in conjunction with sox_read()
	and sox_write()???
8.0.1	The files error.wav and error.txt are dropped.
	Introduced the option -c for an alternative cdrom-device.
	Introduced the option -n to disable the use of cddbget.
	Daisy-player will test if there is a cd-drive.
8.0.2	cd-drive test now works, I hope :)
	cd_dev and cddb_flag in .daisy-player.rc file.
	set the CD speed at 4 so it makes less noise
8.1     
	gvfs has been dropped.
	daisy-player now uses the cdio library.
